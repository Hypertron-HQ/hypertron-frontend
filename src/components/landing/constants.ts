      "Hypertron is private payment infrastructure for Stellar. Businesses can accept and operate private payments through the platform. Developers can integrate private checkout through the API, or call Hypertron privacy infrastructure from their own Soroban applications.",

    question: "Can I integrate Hypertron into my own Soroban application?",

  },
  {
    question: "What does Hypertron make private?",
    answer: [
      "Hypertron is designed to reduce unnecessary exposure of payment information on the public ledger. Depending on the flow, details such as amounts and counterparties can stay private while Stellar settlement remains verifiable.",

    question: "How does selective disclosure work?",
